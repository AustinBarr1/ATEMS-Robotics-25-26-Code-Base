this is the src file for my code I used during the 25-26 pushback season, it runs using Ez-Template and pros. If you want to use the code for yourself you'll need to use
these webpage and install pros and the ez-template for yourself.

https://ez-robotics.github.io/EZ-Template/
https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/

These both run of vscode, after you install pros and open ez template, you should write your own code using my as an example, there are tutorial on the ez template website if needed.
